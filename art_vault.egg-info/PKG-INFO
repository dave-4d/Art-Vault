# ART VAULT

Art vault is a web app used for art vendors to keep track of their sales. 
It's a simple coded project for the final semester project that showcases what I learnt throughout semester. 

The process for using it goes like this: You run the app.py file, you get a link which you Ctrl+Click and you get
redirected to the web app. There you find a clear presentation of what to write in. Then you fill in the required information 
and add it. After that, the database get's updated to include new data you just added.

## Brief Description
